# Smart Manufacturing IoT Monitoring ‚Äì DevOps & Edge Analytics (Learning Project)

This project explores an IoT-data pipeline using real-time sensor data from a synthetic smart manufacturing environment. It is developed as a personal learning exercise to better understand how edge data is ingested, processed, and visualized‚Äîfocusing on DevOps principles, basic telemetry parsing, and system monitoring.

## üìç Purpose

The goal is to simulate a simplified predictive maintenance workflow using open IoT data. While the dataset includes machine learning labels, this project currently **excludes model training** and instead emphasizes:

- Local data ingestion
- Sensor sanity checks and visualization
- MQTT-based message streaming
- Lightweight dashboarding
- Docker-based microservice deployment (FastAPI)

## üîß Dataset Overview

Source: [Smart Manufacturing IoT-Cloud Monitoring Dataset (Kaggle)] 
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/smart-manufacturing-iot-cloud-monitoring-dataset)

- 100,000 time-series sensor records from 50 machines
- Readings include: temperature, vibration, humidity, pressure, and energy
- Timestamps at 1-minute intervals
- Flags for anomalies and machine failures
- Target column: `maintenance_required` (0 or 1)

This dataset is well-suited for building predictive maintenance pipelines, real-time dashboards, and cloud-based IoT systems.
