# Smart Manufacturing IoT Monitoring ‚Äì DevOps & Edge Analytics (Learning Project)

This project explores an IoT-data pipeline using real-time sensor data from a synthetic smart manufacturing environment. It is developed as a personal learning exercise to better understand how edge data is ingested, processed, and visualized‚Äîfocusing on DevOps principles, basic telemetry parsing, and system monitoring.

## üìç Purpose

The goal is to simulate a simplified predictive maintenance workflow using open IoT data. While the dataset includes machine learning labels, this project currently **excludes model training** and instead emphasizes:

- Local data ingestion
- Sensor sanity checks and visualization
- MQTT-based message streaming
- Lightweight dashboarding
- Docker-based microservice deployment (FastAPI)

## üîß Dataset Overview

Source: [Smart Manufacturing IoT-Cloud Monitoring Dataset (Kaggle)] 
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/smart-manufacturing-iot-cloud-monitoring-dataset)

- 100,000 time-series sensor records from 50 machines
- Readings include: temperature, vibration, humidity, pressure, and energy
- Timestamps at 1-minute intervals
- Flags for anomalies and machine failures
- Target column for ML if needed: `maintenance_required` (0 or 1)

-- Further Details

-- Machine Status ‚Äì Indicates whether the machine is Idle, Running, or in Failure
-- Anomaly Flags ‚Äì Identifies extreme values in temperature and vibration
-- Predicted Remaining Life ‚Äì Estimated time before maintenance is needed
-- Failure Type ‚Äì The reason for machine failure (e.g., Overheating, Vibration Issue)
-- Downtime Risk Score ‚Äì Probability of machine breakdown


This dataset is well-suited for building predictive maintenance pipelines, real-time dashboards, and cloud-based IoT systems.

## üöß Launch

1. Build Docker Images             ---->  docker compose build
This step builds both:
	‚Ä¢	The Python App container (send + receive)
	‚Ä¢	The Mosquitto MQTT broker
2. Launch the Containers           ----> docker compose up
   	‚Ä¢	Starts two containers: the app and the broker
	‚Ä¢	Mounts necessary configs and ports
	‚Ä¢	Connects them via a shared network
3. Access the Running Containers   ----> docker exec -it iot-devops-app bash
    (if you want to coinfirm the existance of images ---> docker ps)
4. run the send data and recv data ----> python mqtt_sim/send.py
                                   ----> python mqtt_sim/recv.py
